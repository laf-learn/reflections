When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Well, like this morning, being able to work on multiple computers is great.
So, being able to leave my work laptop at work and continue work at home on
my personal computer if necessary is an incentive for using a remote
repository. It's like collaborating with myself.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If I'm working on changes, pulling before I've committed them could create
conflicts, so it's better to have the pulling behavious be manual. I can 
choose when the right time is to bring in updated versions.
