What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git folder, but does not commit any files.
I need to do it as a first step, to set it up. But it will not
start "working" until I decide what files to add.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area shows you what you intend to add/update in the repository, but
changes have not yet been made there. The working directory shows all files
in the directory, whether or not they are part of the git repo.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Making changes in your working directory, I can work on any piece that I like,
without having to worry if it belongs to the same logical part. I can then
only move the files with logically tied changes to the staging area before
committing, so I'm only committing one logical piece at a time.
